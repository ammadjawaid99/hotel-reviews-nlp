# Trip Advisor Hotel Reviews NLP Data Analysis

This Jupyter notebook analyzes hotel review data from TripAdvisor using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to better understand sentiment in customer reviews and identify patterns that could help hotels improve customer satisfaction.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data cleaning/manipulation
- NLTK for text preprocessing and sentiment analysis
- scikit-learn for ML model building
- matplotlib for data visualization

### Dataset

The dataset contains over 20,000 hotel reviews from TripAdvisor. Each record includes the text of the review, a numeric star rating (1-5), and metadata like the hotel name.

### Summary

The notebook performs the following analysis:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the text for NLP
- Sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive or negative
- Topic modeling to identify common topics/themes in the reviews
- Word clouds to visualize the most frequent words used
- Comparison of star ratings to sentiment labels to see how well they align

### Insights Gained

Some interesting findings from the analysis include:

- Sentiment analysis achieved over 80% accuracy, showing star ratings are a good proxy for sentiment
- Top topics included rooms, staff, food, location, bathrooms - giving hotels actionable feedback
- Most frequent words highlighted amenities that drove positive/negative reviews

This project showcases skills in data wrangling, NLP, ML modeling and communicating results.
